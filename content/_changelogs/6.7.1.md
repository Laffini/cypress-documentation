# 6.7.1

_Released 3/15/2021_

**Bugfixes:**

- Interacting with an element that requires scrolling within an element with `scroll-behavior: smooth` no longer fails Cypress's actionability check. Fixes {% issue 15453 %}.
- A regression in {% url "6.7.0" changelog-6-7-0 %} has been fixed so that the `projectId` will be written correctly to the `cypress.json` file on initial creation without an extra config object. Fixes {% issue 15497 %}.
