<strong class="alert-header">Difference between OS-level and Cypress environment variables</strong>

In Cypress, "environment variables" are variables that are accessible via `Cypress.env`. These are not the same as OS-level environment variables. However, [it is possible to set Cypress environment variables from OS-level environment variables](/guides/guides/environment-variables.html#Option-3-CYPRESS).
