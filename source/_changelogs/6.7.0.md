# 6.7.0

*Released 3/xx/2021*

**Features:**

- The `experimentalRunEvents` configuration flag has been removed. You can now listen to `before:run`, `after:run`, `before:spec` and `after:spec` events in the plugins file without needing the {% url "`experimentalRunEvents`" experiments %} configuration option. See the {% url "`before:run`" before-run-api %}, {% url "`after:run`" after-run-api %}, {% url "`before:spec`" before-spec-api %} and {% url "`after:spec`" after-spec-api %} docs for more information. Addressed in {% issue 15276 %}.
- Cypress now displays the full stack trace from errors thrown in the preprocessor. Addressed in {% issue 15198 %}.

**Bugfixes:**

- When using `experimentalStudio`, {% url "Cypress Studio" cypress-studio %} now records typing by using the value of the input rather than the keys that were pressed. Studio also no longer records pressing special keys (such as arrows or ctrl) except for Enter. Addresses {% issue 15023 %}.
- Empty jQuery objects are now properly shown in error messages in the Command Log. Addresses {% issue 14279 %}.

**Misc:**

**Dependency Updates:**

- Upgraded `electron` from `11.2.3` to `11.3.0`. Addressed in {% issue 15201 %}.
